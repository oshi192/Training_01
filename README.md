# Hello world! (MVC)
The user must enter 2 lines:
1st - hello
2nd - world!
After entering the line, the proramm checks each line for the validity of the etalon one ("Hello" or "World!").
If the input line fails the check, an error message will be displayed and the program will offer to enter again, and so until the correct line is entered.
